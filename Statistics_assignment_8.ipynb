The purpose of post-hoc tests is to determine which specific groups differ from each other and to control for the familywise error rate, which is the probability of making at least one Type I error (false positive) across all the pairwise comparisons. Here are some common post-hoc tests used after ANOVA, along with an example of a situation where each one might be necessary:\n",

    "- Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test: This test is a conservative post-hoc test that is commonly used when the sample sizes are equal across groups. It controls for the familywise error rate by adjusting the significance level for each pairwise comparison. For example, if we have four groups (A, B, C, D), and the overall ANOVA result is significant, we might use Tukey's HSD test to determine which specific groups differ from each other. If the test shows that group A is significantly different from group B and group C, but not group D, we can conclude that group A is significantly different from groups B and C, but not group D.\n",

    "- Bonferroni correction: This test is a simple and commonly used method to adjust the significance level for each pairwise comparison. It divides the significance level (usually 0.05) by the number of comparisons being made. For example, if we have four groups (A, B, C, D), and the overall ANOVA result is significant, we might use the Bonferroni correction to determine which specific groups differ from each other. If the test shows that group A is significantly different from group B, group C, and group D, we can conclude that group A is significantly different from all the other groups.\n",

It compares each treatment group to the control group, while controlling for the overall familywise error rate. For example, if we have one control group and three treatment groups (A, B, C), and the overall ANOVA result is significant, we might use Dunnett's test to determine which specific treatment groups differ from the control group.
