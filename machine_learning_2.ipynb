Two commonly used regularization techniques are L1/L2 regularization, where the penalty is the sum of the absolute/ square values of the model weights. This forces the model to keep the weights small, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out some neurons during training, which helps to prevent overfitting. This technique encourages the model to learn multiple independent features and reduces the dependency between neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that artificially increases the size of the training data by applying various transformations to the data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This helps the model to learn a wider range of patterns and reduces overfitting.\n",

    "- Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique that splits the data into training and validation sets, trains the model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the validation set. This helps to identify overfitting and select the best model that generalizes well on new, unseen data."
