    "Outliers can also affect measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation. Outliers can increase the range of the dataset, which makes it difficult to interpret the spread of the data. Outliers can also increase the variance and standard deviation, which makes the spread of the data appear larger than it actually is.\n",

    "For example, suppose we have the following dataset: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 100]. The range of this dataset is 98, which makes the spread of the data appear much larger than it actually is. The variance of this dataset is 1372.8, which is also significantly larger than it would be if the outlier were not present."
